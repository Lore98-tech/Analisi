#README

This code plot functions y = f(x, k), where x is real and k is a natural number.
To run the code, define a function in Successioni_di_funzioni.py. If possible, k starts from 0 or 1. 
Then you can choose where to stop k, the plot interval on x axis, and a color palette.
Moreover, there is the possibility to plot the derivates of the functions. 
The plot limit on y axis is defined as a constant in function.py and can be changed. 

List of functions:
y = np.sin(np.power(x, 2)/k)
